This doc is about the BOOM Explorer. 

the Pareto
design reduces hardware components on the branch predictor
(i.e., RasEntry, BranchCount, etc.), entries of the reorder
buffer, etc., but enlarges instructions issue width, LDQ, STQ,
etc. Moreover, it has different cache organizations, e.g., different associate sets. Because LSU introduced in Section II-A
tends to become a bottleneck, the Pareto design increases
hardware resources for LDQ, STQ, and meanwhile increases
associate sets and MSHR entries for D-Cache to overcome
more data conflicts. Furthermore, the Pareto design reduces
resources of RAS and BTB since there are not many branches
or jump instructions in these benchmarks. Via reducing redundant hardware resources while increasing necessary compo
